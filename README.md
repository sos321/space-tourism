# Space Tourism website

This is my very first website build alone with React. It allows you to explore the technologies, destinations and crew for your next space trip.

The design is taken from Frontend Mentor challenge [Space Tourism](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3).

## Technologies

The site is static with routes provided by React Router. The animations are made possible by framer motion. The entire page is styled solely with tailwind.

- React
- Framer motion
- React router
- Vite
- TailwindCSS
- Hosting:
  - Netlify

## What I learned

Working with React for the first time on my own wasn't easy. I had to come up with the entire page structures and how to connect them. The concept of reusable components was hard to grasp for me. I also learned the basics of Framer Motion and how to do basic routing in React apps.

- React (components)
- Tailwind styling
- Animations with Framer motion
- Routing with React router
- Netlify

## Biggest obstacle

The hardest part of the website was to make it responsive and viewable on all displays. Working with images and absolute position caused me a lot of trouble and forced me to refactor.

## Possible extensions

- [ ] Optimization
- [ ] More pages
